### Sprint 3 (Week 5-6)
- User Test
- Fixes Bugs

Issues:
1.	Database connections need to be configured when pulled from GitHub.
2.	Database connections are not designed in the best possible way (allot of repetitive code).

Amendment:
1.	Connect your own private database (MySQL) and edit the files and line below with the following information.
Items that need to be changed: See IMG 1.4 (exact lines and files to change)
-	Database Url :
-	Database Username :
-	Database Password :
2.	To eliminate this repetitive code, I would/will use servlet in the future to have standard database connection Java files so the connections only needed to be changed once.
